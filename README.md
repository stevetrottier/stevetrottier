- 👋 Hi, I’m @stevetrottier
- ✨ This is my shiny new github account for participation in Micro Focus repos and other work-related activity
- 👀 I’m interested in enterprise identity and security, microservices, APIs, SaaS, and home automation
- ⭐ Some skills I feel confident in include Java, Javascript, Groovy, Jackson, and Docker
- ⌛ Once upon a time, when it was still pretty new, I co-authored a book about LDAP
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Hibernate, Python, AWS, CloudWatch, Terraform and Terragrunt
